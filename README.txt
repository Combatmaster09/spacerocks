Welcome to SpaceRocks, this is an arcade game in which you control a battleship using the 
arrow keys or WASD to fight your way through an asteroid field. Once you hit the asteroid
using bullets shot via the space bar, it is destroyed. Or is it? After an asteroid is
hit it splits into 2 smaller asteroids, that split into another 2 even smaller ones. level up,
scoring 1000 points, and adding one more full sized asteroid at the start of each level to 
avoid and destroy. Although if you do get a sun in your eye and get hit you can just  hit R to
restart the game, and if you want to do something crazy like touching grass then you can always 
exit via hitting escape. Get the highest score possible to become the ultimate fighter pilot 
worthy of even such greats as Han Duo and his partner Crispy, or even Luke Groundswimmer!
(p.s. The secret button makes the game more challenging on the next level for the experienced 
pilot)
